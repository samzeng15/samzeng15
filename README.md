- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sam Zeng!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a final year CS major doing a Finance CS double degree, with a keen interest in learning new things. With both a technical and finance background, I appreciate not only solving difficult problems but going a step beyond that to see how value can be created in applying these solutions to the real world.
- ðŸŒ± I've worked on a large spread of projects, however recently I've taken a strong interest in machine learning and its practical uses, taking on a variety of projects with different focuses in an attempt to discover the vast applications of AI.
